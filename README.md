# Student Performance Analysis using SQL
This project analyzes my academic performance at McMaster University.  
I worked with my transcript data and ran queries in *PostgreSQL* using *DBeaver*.  

Key goals:
- Calculate a cumulative GPA
- Compare performance across various attributes (e.g., term, season, subject) to observe trends

## Structure

- [`student_performance_analysis.sql`](student_performance_analysis.sql): Main SQL file containing queries and observations
- [`transcript.pdf`](transcript.pdf): my transcript from McMaster University, used as the data source
- [`grading_scheme.pdf`](grading_scheme.pdf): The universityâ€™s official grading scheme
